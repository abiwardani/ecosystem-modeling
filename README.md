# ecosystem-modeling
Simple program to model a closed ecosystem. The ecosystem consists of motile organisms which feed on stationary food items. A depleted food item replenishes in a random location. Organisms that collect more than one food item in one iteration will produce one offspring, whose characteristics are similar to the parent with a chance of mutation.
